# Installing Squidpy

Squidpy is a python package for the analysis and visualization of spatial
molecular data. Squidpy requires Python version >= 3.8 to run. You can either
install Squidpy using `pip` or `conda`. We will be demonstrating how to install
it using `conda`. In order to do so, the user should have `conda` or `miniconda`
installed on their system.

To install Squidpy via Conda run `conda install -c conda-forge squidpy` via the
command line.
