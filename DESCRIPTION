Description: This package serves to show a user how they might utilize the python package squidpy within R. Based on the squidpy paper *site* we reproduce data objects using strictly R code. Using the reticulate and/or basilisk package the user is able import the python package within their R session. This allows the user to use functions from directly from squidpy (and other python packages) with minimal code chagnes. These ideas are all demonstrated in the package vignettes.
